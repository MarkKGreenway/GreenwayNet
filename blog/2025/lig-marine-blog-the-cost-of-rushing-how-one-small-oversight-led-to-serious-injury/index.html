When the pilot arrived, he found the gap too large to cross safely. Focused on final departure preparations, the crew did not respond to his communication attempts. Frustrated after several failed attempts, the pilot tried to climb onto the ladder himself but lost his footing and fell into the water, suffering broken ribs, a back injury, and deep bruises. Fortunately, his life jacket kept him afloat until emergency responders arrived. However, the incident delayed the vessel’s departure by 48 hours and left the pilot unable to work for months. Had the pilot hit his head or been crushed between the ship and the pier, this could have been a fatal accident.This situation highlights the critical need for comprehensive marine insurance. Whether it’s Longshore coverage for injured workers, Maritime Employers’ Liability (MEL) for crew exposure, or Protection &amp; Indemnity (P&amp;I) for liability risks, the right insurance ensures that businesses are protected from financial fallout when accidents occur. A single injury like this can lead to costly medical expenses, lost wages, and legal claims — expenses that could cripple an uninsured operation.Investing in proper risk management and insurance coverage isn’t just about compliance; it’s about safeguarding your business, your crew, and everyone who steps aboard.Mark GreenwayEnter your email address:Delivered by FeedBurner</p> </body></html>
